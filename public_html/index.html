            This project was created during Spring Quarter of the  2019-2020 
            academic year at the University of Washington Bothell. It's built 
            on a game engine used in Professor Kelvin Sung's CSS-452 Game Engine
            Development course, and is primarily written in javascript. 
            The code for this project is completely open source but the art is 
            not our own. Artists are cited where possible, and textures 
            borrowed from Minecraft are under Fair Use. 
            <br> <br>
            What is this terrain generator for? 
            <br> <br>
            The user should note that this terrain generator is not optimized 
            for real-time generation, and it may lack some of the features 
            provided by the generators used in Terraria and Minecraft. However, 
            the simplicity of our three-class generator makes it suitable 
            for the following uses:
            <br> <br>
            &#8226 Generating terrain, then modifying it for use in a game with 
            a static world
            <br>
            &#8226 Featuring simple terrain generation in a technical demo
            <br>
            &#8226 Learning about the inner-workings of a terrain generator 
            and modifying our code for your own purposes.
            <br> <br>
            Listed below are the descriptions for the three javascript classes 
            included in our API. Detailed documentation is available for each 
            function, and tutorials and demos are provided to get you started.

        <h2 class = "text"> TileMap </h2>
        <p class = "text">
            
            This class creates a grid of tiles on which textures can be placed. 
            This is the foundation for a game like Terraria, as blocks can be 
            placed or removed from any part of the map. The TileMap allows for 
            adding and removing tiles, and also includes a tool for optimized 
            collision detection. Users who wish to modify terrain in real time 
            can connect the TileMap to their user interface for easy editing.
            
        </p>
            
        <h2 class = "text"> ShapeGen </h2>
        <p class = "text">
            
            This class provides tools for drawing tiled shapes. It can be used 
            as a stand-alone class for drawing on a tileMap, but its main 
            purpose is to serve as an intermediary between the terrain generation 
            logic and the tile map. Rectangles, triangles, and circles are 
            supported, and shapes can be drawn with simple colors or textures. 
            We recommend that anyone looking to modify the terrain generator 
            start by drawing a few shapes with ShapeGen. 
            
        </p>
            
        <h2 class = "text"> TerrainGenerator </h2>
        <p class = "text">
            
            This class provides the tools and logic to generate realistic 
            terrain. We intentionally chose a small but versatile set of 
            functions that make it easy to start creating worlds while not 
            imposing restrictions on creativity. The Terrain Generator's 
            functions can be broken up into the following categories:
            <br> <br>
            &#8226 Laying the Foundation: Generate flat, bumpy, or hilly 
            terrain at any Y-coordinate.
            <br>
            &#8226 Painting the world: Apply textures to ranges of Y 
            coordinates or layer on textures as if raining from the sky.
            <br>
            &#8226 Add the details: Use a versatile "tree" creator to place 
            ground scatter on the surface of the world.
            <br> <br>
            The TerrainGenerator is designed to be as simple as possible and 
            easy to modify. We suggest that users start with the addTree 
            function, as this can be tweaked to create any shape desired.
