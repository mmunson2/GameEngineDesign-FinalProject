        <p class = "text">
            
            Here's what you came here for - the terrain generator itself. Our 
            focus on simplicity means that this generator uses no advanced noise 
            algorithms or calculus, just a random number generator and a lot of 
            circles. You may notice that there are no setters for X positions 
            outside of the constructor. This is an intentional design choice, 
            as we didn't want to overcomplicate our function signatures. If you 
            want to make different terrain features on the X axis, make a second 
            terrain generator and set its x range accordingly.

            The first set of functions to call are those that create a foundation 
            for your world. generateFlat(), generateBumps(), and generateHills() 
            create features at the Y coordinates you specify. These features will 
            appear as simple green renderables - this is another intentional 
            design choice. Because a variety of textures may be applied to the 
            ground (bedrock, stone, etc), we felt that texturing should be 
            applied after the basic shapes are defined. This is completed with 
            setTexture(), which can apply a texture to a range of Y coordinates.

            But what if I don't want rectangular boundaries between my stone and 
            dirt layers? This is where addTopTiles() comes into play. You can 
            imagine this function as raining a layer of blocks down on your 
            terrain. Placed into a for loop this will layer as much dirt on top 
            of stone as you'd like. You can use the yMin and yMax to only a 
            texture on a certain Y coordinate. This is how we apply snowy grass
            to the top of mountains and regular grass to the valleys in Scene1.

            Finally, you can apply ground scatter with generateTrees(). The 
            height range and texture allow for a wide range of trees to be 
            created. The woodTexture and leafTexture can also be set to null, 
            allowing for cactuses, cobblestone walls, floating orbs, or anything 
            else you can imagine. Flowers and grass textures can be applied by 
            setting the tree height to 1 and setting the leaf texture to null. 

            While we attempted to make our tree generation as versatile as 
            possible, we recognize that it can't create everything. That's where 
            you come in! The addTree and generateTrees functions can easily be 
            copied and modified to generate any shape desired. Try making a 
            pyramid or house and scattering them all over the map! 

            Finally, the getSurfaceCollision function can be used to efficiently 
            retrieve an array of collision boundaries from the surface of your 
            world. This is much more efficient than checking every block, but 
            if your game implements block addition or removal, this method will 
            need to be modified.
